Welcome to Zola Pico! This is a demonstration post showing off the theme's features.

## What is Zola Pico?

Zola Pico combines two excellent tools:

- **Zola**: A blazing fast static site generator written in Rust
- **PicoCSS**: A minimalist CSS framework that styles semantic HTML

Together, they create a blogging experience that's both simple to use and pleasant to read.

## Key Features

### Minimal and Semantic

This theme follows PicoCSS's philosophy of using semantic HTML without excessive classes. The markup is clean and meaningful.

### Dark Mode Support

The theme automatically adapts to your system's color scheme preference. Try switching your device to dark mode to see it in action!

### Responsive Design

Whether you're on a phone, tablet, or desktop, the layout adapts beautifully to your screen size.

### Fast Performance

With no JavaScript dependencies and optimized CSS, pages load instantly.

## Getting Started

To start using this theme:

1. Install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)
2. Clone or download this theme
3. Run `zola serve` to preview
4. Customize `config.toml` to make it your own

That's it! You're ready to start blogging.
